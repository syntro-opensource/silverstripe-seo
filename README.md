# Silverstripe SEO

Silverstripe module for simple SEO optimization of pages

> ### Disclaimer
> This Module is heavily inspired by the [`quinninteractive/silverstripe-seo`](https://github.com/Quinn-Interactive/silverstripe-seo)
> and was originally started as a learning project but grew beyond
> this intention.
>
> We want to provide:
> * Compatibility with `dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`
> * SEO reports to find and fix problems quickly
> * i18n
>
> We aim to keep this module exchangeable with the [`quinninteractive/silverstripe-seo`](https://github.com/Quinn-Interactive/silverstripe-seo)
> module in terms of database column names.
